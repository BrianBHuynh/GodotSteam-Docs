# GodotSteam Documentation

Welcome!  If you find any mistakes or have some additions to make, [please check out our documentation repository here.](https://github.com/GodotSteam/GodotSteam-Docs){ target="\_blank" }

{==
## Where Do I Start?
==}


### In Most Cases

Most users will just want to [install the GDExtension or GDNative plug-in to quickly use the standard GodotSteam.](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2445){ target="\_blank" }

**To get started**:

- [x] Open your Godot editor
- [x] Click on the 'Assets' tab
- [x] Search for 'GodotSteam'
- [x] If using Godot 4.x, install the GDExtension 4.1 / 4.2 plug-in
- [ ] If using Godot 3.x, install the GDNative plug-in

You may need to restart your editor but the _plug-in does not need to be enabled_ manually.  Check by calling the **Steam** class.

**However, you might be trying to make something else.** If so, keep reading to find out about other versions of GodotSteam.

---

### What Are You Making?

Depending on what your end goals are, you will probably want to use a different version of GodotSteam. See which of the following best fits your project.

<div class="grid full cards" markdown>

- 	:material-gamepad-variant:{ .godotsteam .lg .middle } __Singleplayer or Steam Networking__

	You are making a singleplayer game or a multiplayer game that solely uses Steam's networking classes. You also might be just checking things out. You will want the standard GodotSteam version.

	You are making a multiplayer game using Godot 4's multiplayer nodes like synchronizer and spawner but you want to use Steam's networking with it. Sounds like you want the MultiplayerPeer version.

	You are making a singleplayer or multiplayer game with only Steam's networking classes or also with Godot's multiplayer nodes in C#. You also might be checking things out with C#.

	Sadly, there are currently no .NET-enabled versions of GodotSteam yet. However, you can use LauraWebdev's C# bindings with any version of standard version of GodotSteam.

	If you would like to help resolve this issue, we are trying to create Github Action processes to reliably build pre-compiles and templates. [Feel free to check out our existing workflows to edit in C# versions by pull request.](https://github.com/GodotSteam/GodotSteam/){ target="\_blank" }

	You are making a master server that runs somewhere and players connected to it or a dedicated server that players can run themselves and other players connect to that. In that case, you will want to use the GodotSteam Server builds.

### Differences Between Pre-Compiles and Plug-ings

For the most part, the pre-compiles and plug-ins are functionally the same. One major difference is the plug-ins have no in-editor documentation.

GDNative, however, has no access to Steam constants or enums, an issue with Rich Presence on Windows, others which are documented in the [Common Issues section.](issues/common_issues.md/#gdnative)

[Previous versions of all branches can be found on Github.](https://github.com/GodotSteam/GodotSteam/releases){ target="\_blank" }

Pre-compiled editors and template zips are self-contained and have everything you need to work with GodotSteam. The GDNative and GDExtension plug-ins require [an official version of Godot Engine.](https://godotengine.org){ target="\_blank" }

{==
## Compile It Yourself
==}

Roll up your sleeves and build your own versions of GodotSteam. More instructions are available on each branch's readme page or up above [under the ***Compiling*** tab.](howto/modules.md)

### Requirements

If you are compiling the module, GDNative, or GDExtension version yourself, there are a few things you'll need to start working regardless of which flavor you decide to try out.

<div class="grid full cards" markdown>

- :simple-steam: __Steamworks SDK__
	
	While we suggest the latest version of Valve's Steamworks SDK 1.59 or newer, the older versions work well too.

	---

	[:octicons-file-zip-24: Log In and Download The SDK](https://partner.steamgames.com/){ .md-button .md-button--downloads target="\_blank" }

- :simple-godotengine: __Godot Engine Source__

	You will need the version that matches your GodotSteam version. Use the tags section in Github.

	---

	[:fontawesome-solid-code-branch: Grab the Engine Source](https://github.com/godotengine/godot){ .md-button .md-button--downloads target="\_blank" }

</div>

Just make sure there are no compatibility breaks between the SDK and GodotSteam; usually noted in the readme's.
